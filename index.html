      Making minor adjustments with large masses at high speeds.
      The art of making minimal adjustments for maximum gain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Inspired by driving through moderately busy traffic especially
      driving south through Everett on I-5 where you crest hills and
      see lots of the lay of traffic ahead and around you. I often wish
      I could manipulate other cars so they woul go just a bit faster
      or slower so I can make lane changes and get ahead real smooth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine driving a car and trying to maintain a high speed and making
      polite, clean, yet aggressive passes. You're foot is holding down the
      gas, but you're also feathering the gas to gently slow down to fall into
      a lane switch to go around another car and make a pass. You're Heavy
      Feathering the gas and it is especially satisfying when you can cool off
      speed without ever having to touch the brake.

    <p>
      The way I play this game is I try to hold down ACCELERATE as much as
      possible and I try to drive around cars to keep cruising USA baybe.
      Honk the horn to try to get other cars to move right. Click and drag
      other cars for supernatural manipulations.

    <p>
      You're controlling two things:
      <ul>
        <li>the car you're driving</li>
        <li>and pulling around every other car on the road</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Controls:
      <ul>
        <li>arrows keys and WASD for movement</li>
        <li>space honks</li>
        <li>tab switches cars</li>
        <li>x toggles proximity mesh</li>
        <li>m toggles mute</li>
        <li>
          click and drag on another car to feather them faster slower left or
          right to set yourself up for a better position.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      There's a bug where for some reason "your foot slips off the pedal" and
      the gas doesn't stay down. This seems to be random so I have no clue what's
      going on and it is kind of a neat effect really. Forces you to keep jiggering
      the gas pedal again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Cars that get honked at are likely to honk at other cars.
