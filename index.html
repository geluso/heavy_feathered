      Making minor adjustments with large masses at high speeds.
      The art of making minimal adjustments for maximum gain.

      Inspired by driving through moderately busy traffic especially
      driving south through Everett on I-5 where you crest hills and
      see lots of the lay of traffic ahead and around you. I often wish
      I could manipulate other cars so they woul go just a bit faster
      or slower so I can make lane changes and get ahead real smooth.

      Imagine driving a car and trying to maintain a high speed and making
      polite, clean, yet aggressive passes. You're foot is holding down the
      gas, but you're also feathering the gas to gently slow down to fall into
      a lane switch to go around another car and make a pass. You're Heavy
      Feathering the gas and it is especially satisfying when you can cool off
      speed without ever having to touch the brake.

      The way I play this game is I try to hold down ACCELERATE as much as
      possible and I try to drive around cars to keep cruising USA baybe.
      Honk the horn to try to get other cars to move right. Click and drag
      other cars for supernatural manipulations.
